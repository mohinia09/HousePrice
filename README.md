# House Price using Regression
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

## General Information

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
 
The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The alpha vales for Ridge and LAsso regression were: 2 and 0.01 respectively
- The model performance for both were good but Ridge had better results.
- Lasso regression helps better in feature selection over Ridge regression.
